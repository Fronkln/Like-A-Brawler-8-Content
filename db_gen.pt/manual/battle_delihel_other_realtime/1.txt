Member Rank and Benefits

As you continue to use Poundmates, your member rank will increase. As your member rank goes up, you will be able to add <color=striking>benefits</color> when you request someone. These options carry an <color=striking>additional fee</color> in exchange for powering up the Poundmate. The higher your rank, the more Poundmates will have benefits available.
